# Prompt Architecture Toolkit (v1.0)
A practical framework for designing clear, structured, and reliable prompts for LLMs.

This toolkit contains seven cognitive design patterns that improve reasoning, structure,
and output quality across all AI models. It helps writers, researchers, engineers,
analysts, and product teams design prompts that think before they generate.

Repository: https://github.com/fshofi/prompt-architecture-toolkit

## Purpose
Most prompts fail because the structure is unclear. This toolkit fixes that with patterns 
that shape intent, context, and outcome.

## Patterns
1. Intent Loop
2. Cognitive Feedback Cycle
3. Epistemic Scaffold
4. Pattern Transfer
5. Reasoning Spiral
6. Analyst Frame
7. Output Blueprint
